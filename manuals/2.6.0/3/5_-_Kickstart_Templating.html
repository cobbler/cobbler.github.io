   <h1>Kickstart Templating</h1>
<p>Kickstarts automate Red Hat and Fedora based Linux installations.
This document also pertains to templating as it relates to other
distributions, which also have similar answer files.</p>

<p>With any distribution if you are repeatedly installing a lot of
different configurations, you can get into a scenario where you
have too many different answer files to maintain or the answer
files get to be rather complex and unruly. A kickstart templating
system, such as Cobbler's, can help you keep these under control.</p>

<p>When cobbler profiles (created with "cobbler profile add") are
created with the parameter --kickstart and the kickstart lives on
the filesystem, the file is treated as a kickstart template, not a
raw kickstart. This means they contain information about how to
build a kickstart, but a given template might be modified by
various variables on a per profile or per system basis. This allows
you to use the same source information (and maintain that), but
have it work in different ways for different profiles and different
systems.</p>

<p>It also means that Cobbler, when you use "cobbler import" can
assign kickstarts that work for fully automated installs out of the
box, but they are also easy to customize and change by manipulating
settings on cobbler objects or editing the global cobbler settings
file.</p>

<p>The main feature in cobbler kickstart templating is the ability to
declare variables on cobbler objects like distributions, profiles,
and systems. On the command line, this is the --ksmeta parameter.
The same source templates can result in different output based on
different variables set in cobbler with --ksmeta, which this
document will explain.</p>

<h2>Down The Rabbit Hole</h2>

<p>Templating is very powerful, especially if you have a very large
amount of profiles and/or systems to maintain.</p>

<p>Users can just treat templates like kickstarts, not explore this
feature fully, or pretend this feature doesn't exist, but if more
customization is needed, the support is there.</p>

<p>This article will get into a lot of complicated (and optional)
topics, so just take from it what you need. If this sounds too
complicated, it's not required that you understand all of it.</p>

<h2>First off</h2>

<p>Cobbler uses <a href="http://cheetahtemplate.org/learn.html">Cheetah</a> for
its kickstart templating engine. Read more at the Cheetah page and
you will learn a lot of advanced features you can employ in your
kickstart templates. However, knowledge of all parts of Cheetah are
not required. Basic variable solution is automagic and doesn't
require any advanced knowledge of how the templating works.</p>

<p>Cheetah is nice in that most of the things you can do in the
powerful Python programming language you can do in your Cheetah
templates, so it is very flexible. However some things do not look
quite like Python, so you have to pay a little attention to the
syntax.</p>

<h2>Hierarchy</h2>

<p>As with all things in cobbler, kickstart template variables
(--ksmeta) take the following precendence:</p>

<ul>
<li>Distro parameters come first</li>
<li>Profile parameters override Distro Parameters</li>
<li>System parameters override Profile Parameters</li>
</ul>


<p>If a distro has an attribute "bar" and the profile that is the
child of the distro does not, the profile will still have the value
of "bar" accessible in the kickstart template. However, if the
system then supplies it's own value for "bar", the system value,
not the distro value, will be used in rendering the kickstart for
the system. This is what we mean by "inheritance". It is a simple
system of overriding things from the most specific (systems) to the
least specific (profiles, then distros) to allow for
customizations.</p>

<h2>Basic Variable substitution</h2>

<p>Given the following commands</p>

<pre><code>cobbler profile add --name=foo --distro=RHEL-5-i386 --kickstart=/opt/cobbler/templates/example
cobbler profile edit --name=foo --ksmeta="noun=spot verb=run"
cobbler system add --name=bar --profile=foo --ksmeta="verb=jump"
</code></pre>

<p>And the kickstart template <code>/opt/cobbler/templates/example</code>:</p>

<pre><code>See $noun $verb
</code></pre>

<p>The following file would be generated for profile foo:</p>

<pre><code>See spot run
</code></pre>

<p>And for the system, bar:</p>

<pre><code>See spot jump
</code></pre>

<p>This is of course very contrived, though you can imagine
substituting in things like server locations, configuration file
settings, timezones, etc.</p>

<h2>Snippets</h2>

<p>If you find yourself reusing a lot of pieces of code between
several different kickstart templates, cobbler snippets are for
you.</p>

<p>Read more at <a href="Kickstart-snippets">Kickstart Snippets</a></p>

<p>That page also includes some user contributed snippet examples --
some of which make some heavy use of the Cheetah template engine.
Snippets don't have to be complex, but you may find those examples
educational.</p>

<h2>Escaping</h2>

<p>If your kickstart file contains any shell macros like
<code>$(list-harddrives)</code> they should be escaped like this:</p>

<pre><code>\$(list-harddrives)
</code></pre>

<p>This prevents Cheetah from trying to substitute something for
$(list-harddrives), or worse, getting confused and erroring out.</p>

<p>In general, escaping things doesn't hurt, even though in all cases,
things don't have to be escaped.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>This is an $elephant
</code></pre>

<p>If there was no kickstart variable for "elephant", the kickstart
templating engine would leave the string as is ... <code>$elephant</code></p>

<p>You should also be careful of the following stanza:</p>

<pre><code>#start some section (this is a comment)
echo "doing stuff"
#end some section (this is a comment)
</code></pre>

<p>if you want a comment to start with the word "end" place a space
after the "#" like this:</p>

<pre><code># start some section (this is a comment)
echo "doing stuff"
# end some section (this is a comment)
</code></pre>

<h2>Built In Variables</h2>

<p>Cobbler includes a lot of built in kickstart variables.</p>

<h3>What variables can I use?</h3>

<p>Run this command to see all the templating variables at your
disposal.</p>

<pre><code>cobbler system dumpvars --name=system
</code></pre>

<p>Some of the built in variables that can be useful include
$mac_address, $ip_address, $distro, $profile, $hostname, and so
forth. You will recognize these as being commands that you would
see in cobbler command line options.</p>

<p>To make this a bit more clear, look at the following system add
command:</p>

<pre><code>cobbler system add --name=spartacus --profile=f10webserver-i386 --ip-address=192.168.50.5 --mac=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --hostname=spartacus.example.org
</code></pre>

<p>For the above command, assuming the kickstart template for
fc6webserver contained the following line:</p>

<pre><code>echo "I was installed from Cobbler server $server and my system name is $system_name" &gt; /etc/motd
</code></pre>

<p>The above line would be rendered as:</p>

<pre><code>"I was installed from Cobbler server cobbler.example.org and my system name is spartacus"
</code></pre>

<p>Again, the examples above are a bit contrived, but you can see how
every variable given to the command line is accessible within
templating. This is a rather useful feature and prevents having to
specify a lot of additional templating variables with --ksmeta.</p>

<h2>Checking For Variables That Might Not Exist</h2>

<p>Suppose you have some system objects that define a value for "foo",
but sometimes they don't.</p>

<p>The following Cheetah templating trick can be used to access a
variable if it exists, and assign a default value if it doesn't
exist.</p>

<pre><code>#set $selinux_mode = $getVar('selinux', 'enforcing')
</code></pre>

<p>or just</p>

<pre><code>$getVar('selinux', 'enforcing')
</code></pre>

<p>As a corollary, if you need to include a specific line in a
kickstart file only if a variable is defined, that is also doable.</p>

<pre><code>#if $foo
  this line will show $foo but only if it is defined, else there will be nothing here
#end if
</code></pre>

<h2>Networking</h2>

<p>Cobbler actually handles templating around network setup for you,
via some rather clever snippets used in files such as
/var/lib/cobbler/kickstarts/sample.ks</p>

<p>However, if you need to access networking information from systems
in Cobbler templating, you do it as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$system.interfaces['eth1']['mac_address']
</code></pre>

<p>This should also be apparent in the output from "cobbler system
dumpvars --name=foo"</p>

<p>Again, usually you should not have to access these directly, see
<a href="Advanced%20Networking">Advanced Networking</a> for details
about Cobbler templates all the network info out for you.</p>

<h2>Built-in functions and extensibility</h2>

<p>You can optionally expose custom-written functions to all Cheetah
templates. To see a list of these functions you have configured for
your site (Cobbler doesn't currently ship with any) and/or add new
functions, see <a href="Extending%20Cheetah">Extending Cheetah</a>.</p>

<h2>Raw Escaping</h2>

<p>Cobbler uses <a href="http://cheetahtemplate.org">Cheetah</a> for kickstart
templating. Since Cheetah sees "$" as "include this variable", it
is usually a good idea to escape dollar signs in kickstart
templates with \$. However, this gets to be hard to read over
time. It is easier to declare a block "raw", which means it will
not be evaluated by Cheetah.</p>

<pre><code>#raw
This $dollar sign will stay in the output regardless of what the --ksmeta metadata variables are
#end raw
</code></pre>

<p>It is possible to cheat by assigning bash variables from the values
of Cheetah variables, and use them inside raw blocks. This is
useful if you want your shell scripts to be able to access
templating variables but don't really want to make sure escaping is
all super-correct.</p>

<pre><code>%pre
foo = $foo
#raw
This $foo will be evaluated and will not appear with a dollar sign
and if you included funky shell scripts here you wouldn't have to worry
about escaping anything.  The $foo comes from bash and not Cheetah
#end raw
</code></pre>

<h3>Raw escaping and Snippets</h3>

<p>Be aware: raw escaping also applies to SNIPPET directives. For
example:</p>

<pre><code>#raw
$SNIPPET('my_snippet')
#end raw
</code></pre>

<p>Will not work as expected. The result will be:</p>

<pre><code>$SNIPPET('my_snippet')
</code></pre>

<p>Because $SNIPPET is inside #raw #end raw, Cheetah ignores it, and
the snippet is not included. Note this also applies to the legacy
SNIPPET:: syntax.</p>

<p>The #raw #end raw directives should instead be placed inside of
my_snippet.</p>

<h2>Conditionals</h2>

<p>Cheetah supports looping and if statements. For more of this, see
the <a href="http://cheetahtemplate.org">Cheetah</a> web page.</p>

<p>(This section needs to be expanded)</p>

<h2>"Stanza" Support</h2>

<p>Stanzas are the precursor to Cobbler snippets. Certain built-in
complex pieces of code are auto-generated by Cobbler, from within
the Cobbler source code, that vary based upon the configuration of
the cobbler object being rendered. These sections are not user
extensible, unlike the newer snippet support. These are being
explained here to give folks an idea of why they should leave these
weird dollar sign variables in their kickstarts, but in general,
more cobbler stanzas will not be added. The new snippets are the
user-extensible way to go.</p>

<p>Certain blocks of kickstart code are substituted for the following
variables:</p>

<ul>
<li>$yum_repo_stanza -- this is replaced with the code neccessary
to set up any repos that are associated with the given cobbler
profile, for use during install time. This should be present
towards the top of a kickstart, but only for kickstarts that are
RHEL5 and later or FC6 and later. Before those versions,
kickstart/Anaconda did not support the "repo" directive.</li>
<li>$yum_config_stanza -- this is replaced with the code
neccessary to configure the installed system to use the yum repos
set up during install time for regular operation. In other words,
it sets up <code>/etc/yum.repos.d</code> on the provisioned system. This works
for all machines that can have yum installed. If the value in
<code>/var/lib/cobbler/settings</code> for "yum_post_install_mirror" is set,
in addition, the provisioned system will be pointed to the boot
server as an install source for "core" packages as well as any
additional repos.</li>
<li>$kickstart_done -- this is replaced with a specially formatted
wget, that places an entry in the cobbler and/or Apache (depending
on how implemented at the time) log file, allowing "cobbler status"
to better tell when kickstarts are fully complete. The
implementation of what "kickstart_done" means may vary depending
on the cobbler version, but it should always be placed in a
kickstart template as the last line in %post. Beware in version 2.2.0, $kickstart_done does not exist anymore. Use $SNIPPLET('kickstart_done') instead between a cheetah stanza.</li>
<li>(there may be other
<a href="Kickstart%20Snippets">Kickstart Snippets</a> and macros
used not listed above)</li>
</ul>


<p>Over time these will become first class Cobbler snippets.</p>

<h2>Validation</h2>

<p>Cobbler contains a command "cobbler validateks" that will run
ksvalidator (part of the pykickstart package) against all rendered
kickstarts to see if Anaconda will likely like them. It should be
noted that ksvalidator is not perfect, and in some cases, it will
report false positives and/or negatives. However, it is still
useful to make sure that your rendered output from the kickstart
templates is still good.</p>

<p>Testing an install in a VM is often a better idea.</p>

<h2>Looking at results</h2>

<p>As was said earlier, what is provided for --kickstart is a
template, not a kickstart. Templates are used to generate
kickstarts. The actual contents of the files are served up
dynamically from Python and Apache. If you would like to see the
output of cobbler first hand (for your own review), you can run the
following commands:</p>

<p>For profiles:</p>

<pre><code>cobbler profile getks --name=profile-name
</code></pre>

<p>For systems:</p>

<pre><code>cobbler system getks --name=system-name
</code></pre>

<p>(see <a href="/cobbler/wiki/ModPythonDetails">ModPythonDetails</a> for the
URLs the installer actually uses to get to this content)</p>

<h2>Calling Python Code</h2>

<p>Cheetah lets you use python modules from inside the templates.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>#import time
$time.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
</code></pre>

<p>However what modules you can import are very limited for security
reasons. If you see a module cobbler won't let you import, add it
to the whitelist in <code>/etc/cobbler/settings</code>.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>Cheetah makes comments with double hash marks "##". Any line
starting with "##" will not show up in the rendered kickstart
file at all.</p>

<p>Kickstart comments "#" will show up in the rendered output.</p>

<p>Both styles of comments may be mixed. You can use "##" to
describe what you are doing in your templates, and those "##"
comments won't show up when someone looks at the rendered kickstart
file in <code>/var/www/cobbler</code>.</p>

<p>If this sounds complicated, it is. It's even more complicated in
that Cheetah has special meanings for some things starting with
"#" like "#if" or "#include". It's pretty much safe to just use
the single "#" comment form everywhere though.</p>

<h2>Further info</h2>

<p><em>This was originally a separate section in "Advanced topics" (itself originally part of the original, oversized man page. It has been moved here, but needs to be merged properly with the text above.</em></p>

<p>If and only if --kickstart options reference filesystem URLs, --ksmeta allows for templating of the kickstart files to achieve advanced functions.  If the --ksmeta option for a profile read --ksmeta="foo=7 bar=llama", anywhere in the kickstart file where the string "$bar" appeared would be replaced with the string "llama".</p>

<p>To apply these changes, "cobbler sync" must be run to generate custom kickstarts for each profile/system.</p>

<p>For NFS and HTTP kickstart URLs, the "--ksmeta" options will have no effect. This is a good reason to let
cobbler manage your kickstart files, though the URL functionality is provided for integration with legacy infrastructure, possibly including web apps that already generate kickstarts.</p>
