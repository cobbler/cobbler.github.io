<p>Yum repository management is an optional feature, and is not required to provision through cobbler.  However, if cobbler is configured to mirror certain repositories, it can then be used to associate profiles with those repositories.  Systems installed under those profiles will then be autoconfigured to use these repository mirrors in <code>/etc/yum.repos.d</code>, and if supported (Fedora Core 6 and later) these repositories can be leveraged even within Anaconda.  This can be useful if (A) you have a large install base, (B) you want fast installation and upgrades for your systems, or (C) have some extra software not in a standard repository but want provisioned systems to know about that repository.</p>

<p>Make sure there is plenty of space in cobbler’s webdir, which defaults to <code>/var/www/cobbler</code>.</p>

<p>Cobbler reposync is the command to use to update repos as configured with "cobbler repo add".  Mirroring can take a long time, and usage of cobbler reposync prior to usage is needed to ensure provisioned systems have the files they need to actually use the mirrored repositories.  If you just add repos and never run "cobbler reposync", the repos will never be mirrored.  This is probably a command you would want to put on a crontab, though the frequency of that crontab and where the output goes is left up to the systems administrator.</p>

<p>For those familiar with yum’s reposync, cobbler’s reposync is (in most uses) a wrapper around the yum command.  Please use "cobbler reposync" to update cobbler mirrors, as yum’s reposync does not perform all required steps.  Also cobbler adds support for rsync and SSH locations, where as yum’s reposync only supports what yum supports (http/ftp).</p>

<p>If you ever want to update a certain repository you can run:</p>

<p><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ cobbler reposync --only=&quot;reponame1&quot; ...</code></pre></figure></p>

<p>When updating repos by name, a repo will be updated even if it is set to be not updated during a regular reposync operation (ex: cobbler repo edit --name=reponame1 --keep-updated=0).</p>

<p>Note that if a cobbler import provides enough information to use the boot server as a yum mirror for core packages, cobbler can set up kickstarts to use the cobbler server as a mirror instead of the outside world.  If this feature is desirable, it can be turned on by setting yum_post_install_mirror to 1 in <code>/etc/cobbler/settings</code> (and running "cobbler sync").  You should not use this feature if machines are provisioned on a different VLAN/network than production, or if you are provisioning laptops that will want to acquire updates on multiple networks.</p>

<p>The flags --tries=N (for example, --tries=3) and --no-fail should likely be used when putting reposync on a crontab.  They ensure network glitches in one repo can be retried and also that a failure to synchronize one repo does not stop other repositories from being synchronized.</p>
