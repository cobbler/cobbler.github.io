As cloud infrastructures (specifically Infrastructure as a Service platforms) become more commonplace, Cobbler will need to be adapted to provide the same flexibility in image management as it does for bare-metal. The main challenge to adding these features to date has been a lack of hardware for testing.

To overcome this, I have <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/cobbler24">launched an Indiegogo campaign</a> to raise money for the project.

In addition to hardware for adding IaaS platform features, I also plan to use a dedicated server for running continuous integration testing via Jenkins. Right now, all development and testing takes place on a single server running a handful of VM's, so it's quite limiting performance-wise. Having a dedicated system that also automatically runs tests whenever commits are made will greatly speed up the development and release time.

So, please spread the word and help to make Cobbler better!
