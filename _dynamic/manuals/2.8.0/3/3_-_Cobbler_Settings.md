Cobbler has many features, many of which are disabled out of the box for simplicity's sake. Various settings are used to enable these features and to modify how they work, while other settings are used to provide default functionality to base features (for example, the default encrypted password to use). 

This section will cover these settings, as well as the new {% linkup title:"Dynamic Settings" extrameta:2.8.0 %} feature introduced in Cobbler 2.8.0.

To learn more about the advanced/optional features, consult the {% linkup title:"Advanced Topics" extrameta:2.8.0 %} section.
