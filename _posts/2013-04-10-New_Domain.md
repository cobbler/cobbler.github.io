summary: With GitHub's move to the .io domain, I figured it was time to move Cobbler's page to a dedicated domain name.

As you have probably noticed by now, Cobbler has a new domain name. GitHub [recently announced](https://github.com/blog/1452-new-github-pages-domain-github-io) that they were moving pages to the .io domain. While I understand their reasoning, I'm not a fan of the new domain so I figured it was time to make the move to a dedicated domain.

This was a fairly painless process and is hopefully transparent for all users, but if anyone has any issues please let me know.

Thanks and enjoy the new site!
