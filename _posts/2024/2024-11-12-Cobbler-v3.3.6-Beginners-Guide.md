title: Cobbler v3.3.6 Beginner's Guide
author: Sus-Admin
summary: Getting started with Cobbler v3.3.6; basic installation, setup and automated PXE client provisioning
---

This guide is intended to accompany and extend the official Cobbler [Installation](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.6/installation-guide.html) and [Quick Start](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.6/quickstart-guide.html) guides.

Cobbler is an open-source, system deployment and provisioning software which can simplify and automate operating system installations over the network, as well as rudimentary configuration and patch management capabilities and some other features too. It is a modular solution for deploying systems via PXE, where you would normally have to setup and maintain your own DHCP, TFTP and HTTP servers to provide the full PXE boot+install functionality, Cobbler abstracts all (or some) of those services and manages them for you. Cobbler was initially developed at Red Had and is best suited to deploy Red Hat Linux flavors, like Fedora, but it is fairly capable of deploying just about anything, albeit sometimes requiring some advanced customizations.

## Objective

Starting with a fresh installation of Fedora 34 Server (or Workstation - [Fedora download archive](https://archives.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/linux/releases/34/Server/x86_64/iso/)), this guide will detail preparing the system for Cobbler v3.3.6 installation from source, including prerequisite/dependency installations and network setup, and then provide all necessary steps to install and configure Cobbler to automatically provision another LAN host with Fedora 34 or 37 Server through PXE network boot.

## Environment

This guide assumes that both the **Cobbler Server** and **PXE Clinet(s)** are running as **virtual machines (VMs)** under the same **Oracle VM VitualBox** *(Windows 10)* host

- The **Cobbler server VM** is configured with the following system specs:

    - **BIOS or UEFI firmware**

    - **64 GB HDD**

    - **4 GB RAM**

    - **2 vCPUs**

    - **2 virtual network adapters.** 

        1. VirtualBox VM ***Bridged Adapter*** connected to the primary physical NIC on the Windows host so that SSH to the Cobbler server will be more accessible.

        2. VirtualBox VM ***Internal Network*** adapter named ***"cobbler"*** which will have no external network connectivity (closed LAN; no internet access).

- The **PXE client VM** *(the target for network installations)* has the following specs:

    - **BIOS or UEFI firmware** with the following boot order *(See* ***Tips & Troubleshooting*** *section below for more info)*:

        1. Hard Drive

        2. Network

    - **32 GB HDD**

    - **4 GB RAM**

    - **2 vCPUs**

    - **1 virtual network adapter** which is connected to the same ***"cobbler"*** VirtualBox adapter described above.

*This exact configuration is not a strict requirement for deploying systems through Cobbler, but it proves that a PXE client is able to boot and install an operating system over the local network without public internet connectivity, using only the resources immediately available on the VM and the Cobbler server, aleviating a potential bandwidth bottleneck at the WAN.*

## Fedora Server Basics

As stated above, this document outlines the procedures necessary to install and configure Cobbler v3.3.6 on a Fedora 34 host server for local network installations/provisioning through PXE. Additionally, necessary adjustments will be made for security through **selinux** and **firewalld** on the Cobbler server. As such, it is recommended to keep things simple and **limit the number of additional applications installed** to the Cobbler server to **minimize unexpected firewall and selinux complications.**

### Updating

If Cobbler is to be installed on a Fedora 34 *Server* host, and automatic partitioning was used during initial OS installation, be sure to extend the LVM Logical Volme to a more usable capacity (recommended 95%):

```shell
lvextend /dev/mapper/fedora_$HOSTNAME-root -l+95%FREE -r
```

Update the Fedora 34 host with the latest YUM repo updates:

```shell
yum update
```

Install **VirtualBox VM Guest Additions**, either from the YUM repos, or the Guest Adds. CD included with VirtualBox Manager *(YUM method is shown below, but VirtualBox usually recommends using the Guest Adds. CD)*:

```shell
yum install virtualbox-guest-additions
```

### customizing

Install your preferred Linux sys admin tools and configure some convenient bash settings, for example *(PS1 variable controls bash shell prompt)*:

```shell
systemctl enable --now ssh
yum install neovim fzf tmux htop net-tools tftp
[ -e ~/.bash_profile ] && echo 'export PS1="\[\e[1;32m\][\u@\h \W]\$ \[\e[0m\]"' | tee -a ~/.bash_profile || echo 'export PS1="\[\e[1;32m\][\u@\h \W]\$ \[\e[0m\]"' | tee -a ~/.bashrc
```

SELinux and firewalld will be configured after Cobbler has been tested successfully, disable them for now.

```shell
sed -i -E "s/SELINUX=(disabled|enforcing)/SELINUX=permissive/" /etc/selinux/config
setenforce permissive
```

```shell
systemctl disable --now firewalld
```

## Cobbler Basics

> Now would be a good time to power off the Cobbler server to take a VM snapshot.

### Dependencies

Download the Fedora 34 & 37 **Server** installation media (.iso files):

```shell
[ -d ~/Downloads ] || mkdir ~/Downloads
cd ~/Downloads && wget https://archives.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/linux/releases/34/Server/x86_64/iso/Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-34-1.2.iso
cd ~/Downloads && wget https://archives.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/linux/releases/37/Server/x86_64/iso/Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-37-1.7.iso
```

Install dependencies for building and installing Cobbler from Source

```shell
yum install make git python3-devel python3-sphinx python3-coverage openssl httpd-devel
```

> Cobbler is also available through the YUM repos, using `yum install cobbler`

Download **cobbler v3.3.6** source code from the official GitHub repo

```shell
wget -P  ~/Downloads/. https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/archive/refs/tags/v3.3.6.zip

mkdir -p /usr/src/cobbler
cd /usr/src/cobbler
unzip -d . ~/Downloads/v3.3.6
```

Install the runtime dependencies and enable system services *(systemd will probably report some errors...)*

```shell
yum install httpd wget curl rsync dnf-plugins-core dosfstools createrepo_c xorriso python3-mod_wsgi python-cheetah python3-pyyaml python-netaddr python-librepo python-schema syslinux tftp-server dhcp-server pykickstart ipxe-bootimgs ipxe-roms koan mod_ssl python3-pyflakes python3-pycodestyle rpm-build python3-dns python3-file-magic python3-pymongo
systemctl enable --now httpd tftp dhcpd
```

Install the GRUB bootloader and module packages so GRUB can be used as the network bootloader for PXE clients:

```shell
yum install grub2-pc grub2-pc-modules grub2-efi-x64-modules grub2-efi-aa64-modules grub2-efi-arm-modules grub2-efi-ia32-modules grub2-emu-modules grub2-emu-modules grub2-ppc64le-modules grub2-emu
```

### Installation

Install Cobbler

```shell
cd /usr/src/cobbler/cobbler-3.3.6
make install
systemctl restart httpd
```

Reconfigure the **cobblerd** daemon as described in Cobbler's [official docs](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.6/installation-guide.html#id3):

```shell
sed -i "s,usr/bin/cobblerd,usr/local/bin/cobblerd," /etc/cobbler/cobblerd.service
cp /etc/cobbler/cobblerd.service /etc/systemd/system/.
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable cobblerd
```

### Configuration

Reconfigure the default Cobbler settings file to match the local server:

```shell
sed -i "s/manage_dhcp: false/manage_dhcp: true/" /etc/cobbler/settings.yaml
sed -i "s/dhcp_v4: false/dhcp_v4: true/" /etc/cobbler/settings.yaml
sed -i "s/server: 127.0.0.1/server: 10.0.0.10/" /etc/cobbler/settings.yaml
sed -i "s/next_server_v4: 127.0.0.1/next_server_v4: 10.0.0.10/" /etc/cobbler/settings.yaml
```

Optionally, toggle some additional settings:

```shell
sed -i "s/pxe_just_once: true/pxe_just_once: false/" /etc/cobbler/settings.yaml
sed -i "s/enable_ipxe: false/enable_ipxe: true/" /etc/cobbler/settings.yaml
```

> Even if you do not enable iPXE above, it won't hurt to symlink the correct file that cobbler points to in the `/etc/cobbler/dhcp.template` file.
>
> ```shell
> ln -s /usr/share/ipxe/undionly.kpxe /var/lib/cobbler/loaders/undionly.kpxe
> ```

Edit the subnet decaration in **/etc/cobbler/dhcp.tempate** to match the **enp0s8** interface:

```shell
subnet 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
     option routers             10.0.0.1;
     option domain-name-servers 10.0.0.1;
     option subnet-mask         255.255.255.0;
     range dynamic-bootp        10.0.0.100 10.0.0.199;
```

Cobbler should now be able to start up and run `sync` and `check` tasks without fatal errors:

```shell
systemctl restart cobblerd && sleep 10
cobbler sync && sleep 5
cobbler check
cobbler mkloaders
```

Finally, pull the latest official Cobbler signatures

```shell
cobbler signature update
systemctl restart cobblerd && sleep 5
cobbler sync
```

**The Cobbler server is now ready to begin importing distros and deploying systems**

## Fedora 34 PXE Deployment

Mount the Fedora 34 Server installation media and run the `cobbler import`

```shell
mkdir /mnt/Fedora
mount -t iso9660 -o loop,ro /home/fedora/Downloads/Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-34-1.2.iso /mnt/Fedora
cobbler import --name=Fedora34 --arch=x86_64 --path=/mnt/Fedora
```

Optionally, inspect the imported Distribution and child Profile:

```shell
cobbler distro report
cobbler profile report
```

Create a new generic Fedora 34 kickstart file from Cobbler's default `sample.ks` and configure the new Cobbler Profile to use it:

```shell
cat /var/lib/cobbler/templates/sample.ks | grep -v "\--useshadow" | grep -v ^install | sed 's,selinux --disabled,selinux --permissive,' | sed 's,rootpw --iscrypted \$default_password_crypted,rootpw --iscrypted \$default_password_crypted\nuser --groups=wheel --name=fedora --password=\$default_password_crypted --iscrypted --gecos="fedora",' | tee /var/lib/cobbler/templates/Fedora34.ks
cobbler profile edit --name Fedora34-x86_64 --autoinstall Fedora34.ks
```

> This new kickstart file has removed some options that cause fatal errors during installation, and also configures SELinux in `permissive` mode on the resulting system, as well as creating a new admin user named `fedora` which allows for immediate SSH access to the installed system.

Now, create the **PXE Client** VM according to the specs described in the **Environment** section above and note down the vNIC's MAC address.

> At this point, you may run the following commands on the Cobbler server, then start the **PXE Client** VM to test a manual installation over PXE.
> 
> ```shell
> systemctl restart cobblerd
> cobbler sync
> ``` 

Finally, create a new Cobbler System, replacing `aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff` with the MAC Address of the **PXE Client** VM created above, and sync up Cobbler *(More information on Cobbler autoinstall templates and kickstart files in the* ***Tips & Troubleshooting*** *section below)*:

```shell
cobbler system add --name Fedora34 --profile Fedora34-x86_64 --mac-adress "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" --netboot-enabled true --hostname fedora34 --interface enp0s3 --static true --ip-address 10.0.0.11 --gateway 10.0.0.1 --netmask 255.255.255.0 --name-servers "10.0.0.1"
systemctl restart cobblerd && sleep 10
cobbler sync
```

*leave out the `--static true` option in the above command to configure the PXE client to use DHCP for its IP configuration post-install; if using DHCP, you may omit all the command parameters following `--netboot-enabled true`.*

> *The* ***PXE Client*** *VM can now be powered on, and should automatically boot to PXE and install Fedora 34 to the VM HDD using the "Fedora34.ks" kickstart template created above.*
> 
> > The newly installed system will have the password "cobbler" for both users "root" and "fedora" which is configurable through the `default_password_crypted` setting in `/etc/cobbler/settings.yaml` as well as the kickstart template file created above.

## Fedora 37 PXE Deployment

Take similar steps as above to import and autoinstall Fedora 37 Server, being sure to use unique names for Cobbler Distros, Profiles, and Systems, as well as unique MAC addresses and IP addresses for Systems (unless configured differently in `/etc/cobbler/settings.yaml`)

```shell
mount -t iso9660 -o loop,ro /home/fedora/Downloads/Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-37-1.7.iso /mnt/Fedora
cobbler import --name=Fedora37 --arch=x86_64 --path=/mnt/Fedora
cobbler distro edit --name Fedora37-x86_64 --kernel-options ""
cat /var/lib/cobbler/templates/sample.ks | grep -v "\--useshadow" | grep -v ^install | sed 's,selinux --disabled,selinux --permissive,' | sed 's,rootpw --iscrypted \$default_password_crypted,rootpw --iscrypted \$default_password_crypted\nuser --groups=wheel --name=fedora --password=\$default_password_crypted --iscrypted --gecos="fedora",' | tee /var/lib/cobbler/templates/Fedora37.ks
cobbler profile edit --name Fedora37-x86_64 --autoinstall Fedora37.ks
cobbler system add --name Fedora37 --profile Fedora37-x86_64 --mac-address "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" --netboot-enabled true --hostname fedora37 --interface enp0s3 --static true --ip-address 10.0.0.12 --gateway 10.0.0.1 --netmask 255.255.255.0 --name-servers "10.0.0.1"
systemctl restart cobblerd && sleep 10
cobbler sync
```

## Security Hardening

SELinux and firewall operations can seem daunting at first, especially with an application as complex as Cobbler, but the basic configurations here are relatively simple.

> It is possible to lock yourself out of your Linux server with SELinux, so now would be another good time to take a VM snapshot.

### SELinux

SELinux should come enabled by default on a fresh Fedora 34 Server installation, and we set it to `permissive` in the **Base Updates and Configs** section above, but sometimes `selinux` can be disabled on the kernel command line

If `selinux=0` is set in the `/proc/cmdline` file, then follow the instructions found in the `/etc/selinux/config` file for the `grubby` command to enable selinux at boot time. The kernel command line parameters will take precedence over the other configurations.

If the output of the `getenforce` command is already `permissive` skip to the **Enforcing SELinux** section below; if it is `enforcing` skip to the **Cobbler SELinux Config** section.

#### Enabling SELinux

If SELinux was disabled at the kernel command line or in the `/etc/selinux/config` file, be sure to create the `.autorelabel` file at the root of the filesystem, and set SELINUX mode to `permissive` and **NOT** `enforcing` in the `/etc/selinux/config` file.

```shell
sed -i -E "s/SELINUX=(disabled|enforcing)/SELINUX=permissive/" /etc/selinux/config
touch /.autorelabel
```

With selinux enabled at the kernel command line and set to permissive in "/etc/selinux/config" **reboot the Fedora 34 Cobbler server** and observe the filesystem relabel as the system boots.

> The local filesystem maintains no security context labels when SELinux is disbled, so rebooting directly to SELinux `enforcing` mode will prevent the system from booting properly.

#### Enforcing SELinux

Change the active runtime and boot state/mode of SELinux to `enforcing`:

```shell
setenforce enforcing

sed -i 's/SELINUX=permissive/SELINUX=enforcing/' /etc/selinux/config
```

#### Cobbler SELinux Config

WIth SELinux operating in `enforcing` mode, enable the necessary SELinux Booleans which will allow for basic operation of Cobbler:

```shell
setsebool -P cobbler_can_network_connect 1
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_cobbler 1
setsebool -P httpd_serve_cobbler_files 1
```

With SELinux enabled, some files generated/copied/moved by Cobbler will not retain the correct security context labels necessary for proper operation. Create a Cobbler **sync-trigger** to correct the SELinux labels upon any and all successful completions of a `cobbler sync` task.

```shell
echo '#!/bin/bash
restorecon -R /var/lib/tftpboot
restorecon -R /var/www/cobbler' | tee /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/sync/post/zzz-selinux-restorecon

chmod u+x /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/sync/post/zzz-selinux-restorecon
```

issue another `cobbler sync` to check for errors *(should show* ***\*\*\* TASK COMPLETE \*\*\*****)*:

```shell
systemctl restart cobblerd && sleep 10
cobbler sync
```

> Cobbler Triggers will run at different times depending on which directory they are placed in, and in alphabetical order within that directory. This sync-trigger specifically should typically be run after ALL sync tasks/triggers are completed
> 
> > Additionally, if there is an error with a `cobbler sync` task (trigger, or otherwise) before reaching this trigger, the sync task will terminate, and the trigger will not run, causing Cobbler files to not be relabeled appropriately... however, there are likely bigger issues at hand if the `cobbler sync` task is erroring out.
> 
> More info on [Cobbler Triggers](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.6/user-guide.html#triggers)

### Network Security

reduce network exposure with **firewalld** and secure service/daemon settings

#### Firewalld

Firewalld is the default firewall installed on Fedora and most Red Hat distros, verify that it is enabled and running:

```shell
systemctl enable --now firewalld
```

As described above, this Cobbler server has 2 ethernet NICs: **enp0s3** & **enp0s8**

- **enp0s3** being the *upstream* interface which can access the internet

- **enp0s8** being the *downstream* interface which will server the PXE clients

Create a new **firewalld** ***zone*** which **enp0s8** will operate in:

```shell
firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone=cobbler
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=cobbler --set-target=DROP
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=cobbler --add-service=ssh
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=cobbler --add-service=tftp
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=cobbler --add-service=http
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=cobbler --add-service=https
firewall-cmd --reload
```

> Linux ISC DHCP server opens a raw UDP socket with the Linux kernel, bypassing the firewalld rules, so it is not necessary to allow the service/port. Be sure the resulting `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` file is only configured for the desired interface(s) for hosting DHCP.
> 
> - [serverfault](https://serverfault.com/questions/191390/iptables-and-dhcp-questions/) & [stackexchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/447440/ufw-iptables-not-blocking-dhcp-udp-port-67) sources.

Reconfigure **enp0s8** to operate in the **new firewalld zone**

```shell
nmcli con mod enp0s8 connection.zone cobbler
```

> As defined above, this zone will NOT permit inbound ICMP traffic like ping

For simplicity, **enp0s3** can be left in the **default firewalld zone** (verify the current active zones with `firewall-cmd --get-active-zones`)

#### Service confinement

On the topic of network security, we should also restrict our Cobbler services to only listen on the PXE server interface.

- configure HTTP to only listen on the PXE server interface:

```shell
sed -i 's,^Listen.*,Listen 10.0.0.10:80,' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```

 - Create a local systemd service for tftpd, modified from the original config to only listen on a specific IP address:
 
```shell
systemctl stop tftp.service
systemctl stop tftp.socket

cp /lib/systemd/system/tftp.service /etc/systemd/system/.
sed 's,ListenDatagram=69,ListenDatagram=10.0.0.10:69,' /lib/systemd/system/tftp.socket | tee /etc/systemd/system/tftp.socket
```

- now, reload the systemd configuration and restart services

```shell
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart tftp httpd
```

> Feel free to comment with additional security hardening measures you would employ.

## Tips & Troubleshooting

1. Cobbler's [official docs](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.6/installation-guide.html#id2) advise that installing and running Cobbler in a virtual environment is not possible, but I have had no issues related to virtualization.

1. Some dependencies are missing from the official [Cobbler docs](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.6/installation-guide.html#packages). Have a look at the [dockerfile](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/blob/v3.3.6/docker/rpms/Fedora_34/Fedora34.dockerfile) located in cobbler's source code for a more complete list.

1. It's always a good idea to manually install the desired distro (Fedora 34 or 37 Server in the case of this guide) to the desired hardware (VirtualBox VM in this case) before attempting a network installation, to validate compatability.

    - Any Fedora installation, whether installed manually or automatically, should always contain the file `/root/anaconda-ks.cfg`, which is the kickstart file used to install that particular system.

    - Depending on your deployed system of choice (Fedora 34 or 37 Server here) if you are having issues, you may want to familiarize yourself with the installation system environment.

        1. With most distributions, while the installer is progressing and outputing logs to the monitor (over TTY/GUI, not serial or IPMI session), you can press **ALT+F2** or **ALT+F3** or a similar key combo to access a privileged shell to troubleshoot.

        1. some commands you may want to try on the installer system include:

            ```shell
			dmesg
            cat /proc/cmdline
            less /var/log/syslog
            mount
            ls -la
            ls -la /tmp
            ls -la /
            cpuinfo
            lsblk
            lsmod
            uname -a
            cat /etc/os-release
            lsb_release -a
            echo $SHELL
            ```

1. By default, Cobbler's DHCP server attempts to detect the PXE client's boot firmware type in order to provide a BIOS or UEFI compatible bootloader *(BIOS: "grub.0" - UEFI: "grubx64.efi")*. If using **BIOS firmware** for the PXE client VM, the Cobbler server's DHCP service may not provide the right bootloader.

    1. manually set the bootloader for a Cobbler Profile or System with the following command (the `filename` value corresponds to the `filename` variable for the Cobbler System in the generated `dhcpd.conf` file, and is a local system path to the desired bootloader file relative to Cobbler's tftp root directory: `/var/lib/tftpboot`):

        - `cobbler <profile|system> edit --name <name> --filename grub/grub.0`

    1. The PXE client software that comes with VirtualBox VM **BIOS & EFI** firmware **DOES NOT** support HTTP as a download protocol, so it may be best to leave iPXE disabled in `/etc/cobbler/settings.yaml`

        - HTTP can always be utilized if you boot the PXE client from CD using the latest [ipxe.iso](https://boot.ipxe.org/ipxe.iso)

1. The autoinstall template files "Fedora34.ks" "Fedora37.ks" & "sample.ks" located in `/var/lib/cobbler/templates` are used to dynamically generate the specific kickstart files for either a Cobbler Profile or System at the time of installation

    1. These templates use variables local to the Cobbler server to compose a specific configuration for the desired installation, but you can always craft an explicit kickstart file (without variables or snippets) manually and copy it to the same `/var/lib/cobbler/templates` directory and assign a Cobbler Profile or System to use that specific file with the command: `cobbler <profile|system> edit --name <name> --autoinstall <file>` **just be sure to escape any dollar-signs ($) with back-slashes (\\), otherwise they may be interpretted as variables by Cobbler**

    1. The final autoinstall files (`kickstart` for RHEL distros, `preseed` for Debian, `cloud-init` for Ubuntu, `autoyast` for OpenSUSE, `answerfile` for Windows as well as XCP-ng, although dissimilar schemas) are hosted over HTTP by Cobbler and, by default, assigned to a Cobbler System or Profile via the bootloader config (GRUB or pxelinux) under `/var/lib/tftpboot/grub/system` or `/var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg` directories, or in `/var/lib/tftpboot/grub/x86_64_menu_items.cfg` file.

        ```shell
        curl http://localhost/cblr/svc/op/autoinstall/profile/Fedora34-x86_64
        curl http://localhost/cblr/svc/op/autoinstall/profile/Fedora37-x86_64
        curl http://localhost/cblr/svc/op/autoinstall/system/Fedora34
        curl http://localhost/cblr/svc/op/autoinstall/system/Fedora37
        ```

    1. There are several template files and accompanying snippets that come default with Cobbler which you can look at if you have any questions about how the Cobbler templates *(Python Cheetah templates)* work. Located in `/var/lib/cobbler/templates` & `/var/lib/cobbler/snippets`

1. Optionally, remove the deprecated ***"tree"*** option from the Cobbler Distro `kernel-options` which can be used in the kickstart file instead. This option will be ignored anyway by the installer.

    ```shell
    cobbler distro edit --name Fedora34-x86_64 --kernel-options
    ```

    - cobbler still appropriately sets the "inst.repo" kernel-option in the GRUB or PXE kernel-options. This is likey managed by the Cobbler Profile's ***"tree"*** variable *(seen with `cobbler profile report` above)* or the Profile's config file in `/var/www/cobbler/distro_mirror/config` directory

**here are some helpful troubleshooting commands on the Cobbler server**

```shell
