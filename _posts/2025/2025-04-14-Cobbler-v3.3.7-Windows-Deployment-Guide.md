title: Cobbler (v3.3.7) Windows Deployment Guide
author: Sus-Admin
summary: Deploying Microsoft Windows 10 & 11 via PXE network boot.
---

This guide assumes that you have a Fedora 34 server or workstation system configured to run Cobbler v3.3.7 similarly to the [Cobbler v3.3.6 Beginner's guide](/blog/2024/11/12/Cobbler-v3.3.6-Beginners-Guide.html).

## Objective

Starting where the [Beginner's guide](/blog/2024/11/12/Cobbler-v3.3.6-Beginners-Guide.html) left off, further configure the Cobbler v3.3.7 server to deploy both Windows 10 and Windows 11 via PXE network boot, using the same system and network environment. This guide assumes that you still have `selinux` and `firewalld` configured and enabled as described in the Beginner's guide. 

### Caveats

1. **IMPORTANT:** There was a frequent issue on PXE clients using VirtualBox EFI firmware. For this reason, it is recommended to run both Cobbler server and PXE client as either bare metal systems or [VMWare Workstation/Fusion](https://blogs.vmware.com/workstation/2024/05/vmware-workstation-pro-now-available-free-for-personal-use.html) or [HyperV](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/hyper-v-overview) VMs for UEFI installations.

    - You may experience different results depending on your hardware and Windows or VirtualBox versions and settings; more info in the **Tips & Troubleshooting** section below

1. This guide assumes you have already acquired the Windows 10 and 11 64-bit ISO installation files by using the [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) and [Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11) Media Creation Tool

    - Also on the Windows 11 download page linked above is the minumum system requirements for installing Windows 11, which include UEFI Secure Boot and TPM support, making a *supported* installation to a VM an advanced topic beyond the scope of this guide.

        - This guide will provide a workaround for those requirements as a proof of concept, but additional information on deploying via PXE with Secure Boot enabled can be found in Cobbler's [official docs](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.7/user-guide/wingen.html).

## Cobbler Server Prep

Enable the Windows support features as well as iPXE configs in Cobbler.

### Dependencies

Install some additional [dependencies](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.7/user-guide/wingen.html#installation-quickstart-guide) required by Cobbler

```shell
yum install -y samba python-hivex python-pefile wimlib-utils python3-ldap openldap-servers openldap-clients
systemctl enable smb
```

### Cobbler Server Settings

Enable Windows support in Cobbler's settings, as well as ipxe, if not enabled already

```shell
sed -i 's/windows_enabled: false/windows_enabled: true/' /etc/cobbler/settings.d/windows.settings
sed -i "s/enable_ipxe: false/enable_ipxe: true/" /etc/cobbler/settings.yaml
systemctl restart cobblerd
```

Download the `wimboot` image from iPXE's GitHub to the Cobbler `loaders` directory and sync cobbler

- Also, be sure to link the approriate bootloader images to the Cobbler `loaders` directory if not done already *(since the PXE software included with VMWare Workstation/Fusion and VirtualBox VMs do not support downloads via HTTP)*.

```shell
wget https://github.com/ipxe/wimboot/releases/latest/download/wimboot -P /var/lib/cobbler/loaders
ln -s /usr/share/ipxe/undionly.kpxe /var/lib/cobbler/loaders/.
ln -s /usr/share/ipxe/ipxe-x86_64.efi /var/lib/cobbler/loaders/.
ln -s /usr/share/ipxe/ipxe-snponly-x86_64.efi /var/lib/cobbler/loaders/.
cobbler sync
```

Edit the `/etc/samba/smb.conf` file to match the below text-block

{% capture file %}{% include smb.conf.txt path="_includes/smb.conf.txt" %}{% endcapture %}
{% assign lines = file | newline_to_br | strip_newlines | split: "<br />" %}
{% for line in lines %}{{ line | prepend: "    " }}
{% endfor %}

> More info on this service and configuration in the **Tips & Troubleshooting** section below

Enable and start the SMB service

```shell
systemctl enable --now smb
```

Now, fix the `dhcp.template` file to properly detect PXE client firmware type during DHCP and enable iPXE chainloading for a more reliable experience on PXE clients.

```shell
sed -i 's,filename "http://\\\$cobbler_server/cblr/svc/op/ipxe/system/\\\$iface.owner";,filename "http://\$cobbler_server/cblr/svc/op/ipxe/system/\$iface.owner";\\n            } else if exists system-arch and option system-arch = 00:07 {\\n                filename "ipxe-x86_64.efi";\\n            } else if exists system-arch and option system-arch = 00:08 {\\n                filename "ipxe-x86_64.efi";\\n            } else if exists system-arch and option system-arch = 00:09 {\\n                filename "ipxe-x86_64.efi";,' /etc/cobbler/dhcp.template
```

- The above command should edit the below **original** text block to match the following **updated** block in the resulting `dhcp.template` file:

    - **original**

                  #if $iface.enable_ipxe:
                      if exists user-class and option user-class = "iPXE" {
                          filename "http://$cobbler_server/cblr/svc/op/ipxe/system/$iface.owner";
                      } else {
                          filename "undionly.kpxe";
                      }
                  #end if

    - **updated**

                  #if $iface.enable_ipxe:
                      if exists user-class and option user-class = "iPXE" {
                          filename "http://$cobbler_server/cblr/svc/op/ipxe/system/$iface.owner";
                      } else if exists system-arch and option system-arch = 00:07 {
                          filename "ipxe-x86_64.efi";
                      } else if exists system-arch and option system-arch = 00:08 {
                          filename "ipxe-x86_64.efi";
                      } else if exists system-arch and option system-arch = 00:09 {
                          filename "ipxe-x86_64.efi";
                      } else {
                          filename "undionly.kpxe";
                      }
                  #end if


Finally, enable SELinux and Firewalld allowances for SMB server

```shell
setsebool -P samba_export_all_ro 1
setsebool -P cobbler_use_cifs 1

firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=cobbler --add-service=samba
firewall-cmd --reload
```

## Windows 10 PXE Deployment

mount the Windows 10 installation media and import the distro into cobbler:

```shell
mkdir /mnt/Windows10
mount -o ro,loop ~/Downloads/Win10_22H2_English_x64.iso /mnt/Windows10
cobbler import --name Win10 --path /mnt/Windows10
```

***Optional:*** If the PXE client will use legacy-BIOS firmware instead of UEFI, toggle `uefi` to `false` in the Cobbler Profile autoinstallation metadata:

```shell
cobbler profile edit --name Win10-x86_64 --autoinstall-meta 'uefi'='false' --in-place
```

> More info in Cobbler's [official docs](https://cobbler.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.7/user-guide/wingen.html).

Finally, create a new Cobbler System to PXE boot and automatically install Windows 10 Pro, replacing the *"aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff"* with the MAC address of your PXE client, being sure not to use a duplicate MAC address of any other Cobbler System, then sync up Cobbler.

```shell
cobbler system add --name Win10 --profile Win10-x86_64 --mac-address "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" --netboot-enabled true --enable-ipxe true
cobbler sync
```

The **PXE Client** VM can now be powered on, and should automatically boot to PXE and install Windows 10 to the VM HDD using the "autounattended.xml" answerfile.

- See the Tips & Troubleshooting section below for a fix for an issue encountered on the PXE client during the start-net.cmd script on both VirualBox and VMWare VMs

## Windows 11 PXE Deployment

***Optional:*** If installing Windows 11 on unsupported hardware, use the following commands to edit the `startnet.template` file in order to bypass hardware requirements for the PXE client.

```shell
CMD1=$(echo 'reg add HKLM\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\LabConfig /v BypassSecureBootCheck /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f' | unix2dos)
CMD2=$(echo 'reg add HKLM\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\LabConfig /v BypassTPMCheck /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f' | unix2dos)
CMD3=$(echo 'reg add HKLM\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\LabConfig /v BypassRAMCheck /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f' | unix2dos)
CMD4=$(echo 'reg add HKLM\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\LabConfig /v BypassCPUCheck /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f' | unix2dos)
CMD5=$(echo 'reg add HKLM\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\LabConfig /v BypassStorageCheck /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f' | unix2dos)
CMD6=$(echo '\$distro_share\\sources\\setup.exe \$unattended' | unix2dos)
sed -i -E "s,^#else.?$,#else if \$os_version == \"11\"\n${CMD1}\n${CMD2}\n${CMD3}\n${CMD4}\n${CMD5}\n${CMD6}\n#else," /etc/cobbler/windows/startnet.template
```

Now, take similar steps as with Windows 10 to import and automatically deploy Windows 11 Pro over PXE.

```shell
mkdir /mnt/Windows11
mount -o ro,loop ~/Downloads/Win11_24H2_English_x64.iso /mnt/Windows11
cobbler import --name Win11 --path /mnt/Windows11
cobbler system add --name Win11 --profile Win11-x86_64 --mac-address "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" --netboot-enabled true --enable-ipxe true
cobbler sync
```

The **PXE Client** VM can now be powered on, and should automatically boot to PXE and install Windows 11 to the VM HDD using the "autounattended.xml" answerfile template.

## Tips & Troubleshooting

1. The [Cobbler 3.3.6 Beginner's Guide](/blog/2024/11/12/Cobbler-v3.3.6-Beginners-Guide.html) **Tips & Troubleshooting** section contains some basic recommendations and limitations of Cobbler which will not be repeated here.

1. It's important to understand how Cobbler manages Windows distros and deployments *by default*, as there are certain implicit limitations not present with other distros.

    - Cobbler has 3 main templates for Windows distro management, all located in `/etc/cobbler/windows` directory (instead of the usual `/var/lib/cobbler/templates` and `/var/lib/cobbler/scripts` directories), which effectively limit Windows deployments to `cobbler profile` level customizations

        - `startnet.template`: Generates "startnet.cmd" which gets archived/compressed into the WinPE image (loaded from PXE) in order to start Windows `setup.exe` on the PXE client with the associated Answerfile

        - `answerfile.template`: Generates "autounattended.xml" answerfile with **profile** attributes to be retrieved over SMB by PXE clients for unattended installations.

        - `post_ins_cmd.template`: Generates "post_install.cmd" which is used in the Answerfile to retrieve the `autoinstall` file (post-install script) defined for the **profile**

            - By default, the autoinstall file (post-install script) `/var/lib/cobbler/templates/win.ks` has no effect. 

    - The `autoinstall-meta` parameters *(used to specify the boot files and how to download them, answerfile and post_install templates for unattended installations, as well as set firmware/partitioning mode)* can be configured at the `cobbler system` (or `profile`) level and given unique names to generate different files for use by diffrent profiles or systems, but neither the `answerfile.template` or `post_inst_cmd.template` files are system-level aware, they only consist of **profile-level** settings.

        - Only MAC address and other DHCP-related options will be used for *Windows* `cobbler system` items, in addition to the above `autoinstall-meta` parameters, which have limited functionality for Systems.

    - Windows is limited in the [ways to provide an Answerfile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-setup-automation-overview#implicit-answer-file-search-order), it cannot be specified in boot/kernel parameters like many linux distros

    - This is all only *default* behavior in cobbler, and it would be possible to program additional logic into the `startnet.cmd` or `post_install.cmd` scripts, for instance, to retrieve a diffent answerfile or post-install script based on the hostname (configurable through DHCP) or MAC address. However, that would come with additional limitations and requirements beyond the scope of this guide.

1. **VirtualBox Issues**

    - Specifially, the `ipxe-x86_64.efi` bootloader would fail to "initialize devices" and even though using the `ipxe-snponly-x86_64.efi` bootloader would load properly, the PXE client VM would *usually* just hang when downloading one of the WinPE files (i.e. `wimboot`, `boot.sdi`, `bootmgr.exe`, `bcd`, `winpe.wim`)

        - Tried several troubleshooting steps and could not get a consistent fix:

            - Tried different virtual network adapters.

                - Using the "Paravirtualized Network (virtio-net)" adapter did resove this issue with the iPXE boot process and load into the WinPE/wimboot image successfully, but then did not detect any network adapters and failed to begin Windows Setup; further troubleshooting would be beyond the scope of this guide.

            - Tried running PXE client on another host PC with different VirtualBox version

            - Tried installing the appropriate VirtualBox Extensions for my version of VB.

            - Disabled Memory Isolation in Windows Security (and other security options) on VirtualBox Host.

            - Tried with and without "Virtual Machine Platform" and "Windows Hypervisor Platform" Windows Features installed/enabled.

            - Tried compiling latest and previous versions of ipxe.efi (snp, intel, realtek, etc...) bootloader from source
			
            - Found no relevant entries/errors in VirtualBox VM logs *(debug logs enabled)* or Windows Event Viewer and nothing abnormal in Cobbler server logs (HTTP, TFTP, DHCP).

    - A live Windows 10 installation can be easily converted from MBR (legacy-BIOS) to GPT (UEFI) via powershell commands, which can be used as a workaround for compatibility with VirtualBox UEFI firmware

        - source: [mbr2gpt](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-convert-mbr-disk-gpt-move-bios-uefi-windows-10).


1. **start-net.cmd issue**

    - The `smb` linux service used to host the installation files for the PXE client  on the Cobbler server would be unresponsive during some installations, primarily when running the `startnet.cmd` script on the PXE client to start Windows Setup, which caused the installation to stall and error-out occasionally.

        - After reading through the manpage (`man smb.conf`) and trying several different configurations the problem persisted

        - Make the following edit to the `startnet.template` file to account for this occasional unresponsiveness/lag from the SMB server by first enumerating the SMB share until it responds.

          ```shell
          CMD=$(echo 'dir \$distros_dir || GOTO wno20' | unix2dos)
          sed -i "s,net use z:,${CMD}\nnet use z:," /etc/cobbler/windows/startnet.template
          ```
